In this project I implemented the Adapter Pattern using Java to make different media players work under one common interface. The MediaPlayer interface is the target, while AdvancedMediaPlayer classes like Mp4Player and VlcPlayer are adaptees with incompatible methods. The MediaAdapter acts as a bridge, allowing the AudioPlayer (client) to play multiple file formats without changing its code. This solution follows clean code principles: each class has a single responsibility, new formats can be added easily (open/closed principle), and the code uses clear naming and interfaces for better readability and maintainability.
